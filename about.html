                <p>
                  I enjoy working on my strength, speed, conditioning, agility, and overall sports performance outside of my required team practices. Becoming a stronger athlete allows me to participate at my highest level in all of my sports. I enjoy pushing myself as hard as I can and always giving 110%, because in the end the harder you work, the more you get out of it.<br>
                  The places I train include: <br>
                  ATH(Athlete Training and Health)<br>
                  Memorial Hermann Ironman Sports Medicine Institute<br>
                  Parisi Speed School<br>
